# playbooks-raspberrypi

Ansible Playbooks to provision my personal Raspberry Pis.

You won't be able to run the entire playbooks because my Ansible Vault Key is needed for some commands.

(In Progress)

## Note

On my environment, there're lines as follows in `/etc/hosts`:

```
192.168.1.23    pi1
192.168.1.30    pi2
```
